Rationale for using data structure
- BST is used to store date that exist in data retrieved from csv file 
	- Purpose: Used to check whether the date existed in the BST
- Map is used to store List<WindLogType> with int year as a key
	- Purpose: To store List data structure in a specific year which reduce the amount of operation to search required data
- List is used to WindLogType object for a specific year
	- Purpose: To store all WindLogType with a specific year into a List data structure
- Vector data structure has been used on date,time,utility class for easier implementation to iterate through the vector to retrieve required data

Things that are not working
- Catching exception errors are not implemented in this program
- There are some data overlapping date inserted into the list for example 2014 data have 1 data with 2015 date
  since the list are search and obtain using the criteria sorted by year and month this problem has been resolved
  but these data that are overlapping will be ignored in this system



Things that are working
- Function calculating Average wind speed and average ambient air temperature for a specified month and year
- Function calculating Average wind speed and average ambient air temperature in a specified year
- Function calculating Total solar radiation in kWh/m^2 for each month of a specified year
- Function Output data to a file with average wind speed (km/h), average ambient air temperature and total solar radiation in kWh/m^2 for each month of a specified year.
- Display all timing with highest solar radiation in a specific date 
- Uploading all csv stated in met_index.txt file to proper data structure
- Storing data to specific classes object in WindLogType class during populating data to data structure
